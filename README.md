# Memory Scanner Library

The **SlowScanner Library** is a lightweight and flexible memory scanning libary. It allows you to read and write virtual memory using Windows API or Kernel drivers to avoid anti-cheat detections.
## UI Support

The project as well the documentation of SlowScanner and a custom Kernel Driver is avaiable at [GuidedHacking](https://guidedhacking.com/resources/gh-kernel-memory-scanner-for-bypassing-anticheats.1340/).<br><br>
