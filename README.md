# Memory Scanner Library

The **Memory Scanner Library** is a lightweight and flexible solution designed to work with custom drivers. It allows you to read and write virtual memory without being blocked by anti-cheats.

This library is:

- **Easily customizable** – use it with any custom Kernel Drivers.
- **Highly integrable** – plug it into existing projects with minimal effort.
- **Anti-cheat Bypass** – bypass anticheat limitations by using Kernel Drivers.
